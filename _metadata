  "description" : "I made this mod mainly for myself, but decided to share with everybody.\nThis mod adds whole new planets with their own biomes, monsters, hazards and treasure. The mod adds new unique weapons, armor, cosmetics, augments/collars, spawners, codexes, throwables and other equipment.\n[url=https://github.com/Ceterai/Enternia]GitHub page[/url].\n[url=https://github.com/Ceterai/Enternia/wiki]Official Wiki[/url].\n\n[b]Version 1.7: Imperial Arsenal[/b] is out! Check out the changelog for details.\nThe full list of changes can be found in the changelog file on the GitHub page or in the Steam changelog page.[h3]Where to start[/h3]\nTo explore the worlds added by this mod, try to find new planet types around tier 3+ stars!\n\nTo start progressing in the mod content, craft an Alta Crafting Station! It should be available at the inventor's table.\nFrom there, you'll be able to craft:[list]\n[*]mod equipment (armor, weapons, throwables, etc);\n[*]other mod crafting tables;\n[*]all mod items that can normally be only found through loot (requires tier 6).[/list]\nOther crafting tables include:[list]\n[*]Alta Constructor for crafting objects/decorations/traps (upgrading to tier 6 allows you to even craft natural objects and loot tables);\n[*]Alta Datacenter for crafting codexes the tell you the lore and/or explain how certain mod items work (highly recommend to read them so you don't have to visit the wiki);\n[*]Deprecation Station is a tiny crafting table that allows you to convert deprecated items/objects to new ones, or exchange Perfectly Generic Items for different presents.[/list]\n\nThis mod doesn't require any other mods to work and should be FU-compatible.\nTabula Rasa compatible.",
