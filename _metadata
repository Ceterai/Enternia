  "description": "I made this mod mainly for myself, but decided to share with everybody.\nThis mod adds a new playable race, 2 new planets with their own biomes, monsters, many hazards and treasure. The mod adds new unique weapons, armor, cosmetics, augments/collars, spawners, codexes, throwables and other equipment.\nAll new content can only be found on those 2 planets, is fairly balanced, and thus doesn't interfere with normal gameplay!\n\nCheck out the mod page for more info. Or, even better, check out the mod's Wiki!\n\nWhere to start:\n\n- First of all, get the My Enternia Guide at Treasured Trophies!\n\n- To explore the worlds added by this mod, try to find new planet types around tier 3+ stars!\n\n- To start progressing in the mod content, craft an Alta Crafting Station! It should be available at the tier 2 Inventor's Table.\n  From there, you'll be able to craft:\n  - mod equipment (armor, weapons, throwables, etc);\n  - other mod crafting tables;\n  - all mod items that can normally be only found through loot (requires max tier).\n  Other crafting tables include:\n  - Alta Constructor for crafting objects/decorations/traps (upgrading to max tier allows you to even craft natural objects and loot tables);\n  - Alta Datacenter for crafting codexes the tell you the lore and/or explain how certain mod items work (highly recommend to read them if you don't have to visit the wiki);\n  - Alta Upgrade Station for upgrading some mod items in exchange for Gheatsyn Shards.\n\nThis mod doesn't require any other mods to work and should be FU-compatible.\nTemporarily incompatible with NpcSpawner+ - use MEAC NpcSpawner+ Patch if you want to create alta npcs with it.\n\nSupported Addons:\n\n- Tabula Rasa (most items and objects are available at the table);\n- Spawnable Item Pack (all objects and a lot of items are available here, though less than at Tabula Rasa. I would recommend using max tier Alta Crafting Station, Alta Constructor and Alta Datacenter for all recipes);\n- Equivalent Exchange (all plant-based and non-organic materials can be studied at the Farm Table and the Mine Table respectfully. Nothing fot the Hunt Table);\n- Improved Food Descriptions (proper support for all effects added by this mod);\n- More Planet Info (proper support for all effects, weather and biomes of this mod);\n- True Space (planets added by this mod are able to spawn near True Space stars. Alterash can spawn as a mild/cool planet or satellite, Alterash Prime as a cool/cold planet or satellite);\n- Race Traits (check mod screenshots for stats);\n- Frackin' Races/Frackin' Universe (PARTIAL: no FU BYOS support. If you need it, you can get it with Alta FU Patch+);\n- Quickbar Mini/Stardust Core Lite (adds Alta Scanner to the quick bar);\n- Scripted Artificial Intelligence Lattice (Customisable A.I.!) (adds 4 A.I. chips that modify S.A.I.L. with alta ship A.I. features and makes alta S.A.I.L. compatible with chips) - if you only want the chips and not the rest of the mod - use Alta A.I. Chips mod instead;\n- Wardrobe Interface (all armor and clothing from the mod can be found in the wardrobe with proper dying options);\n- Craftable Seeds (all crops and saplings from this mod can be crafted in the Seed Maker);\n- Recipe Browser (adds all recipes and crafting stations from this mod to the interface);\n- Starburst Rework (electric protection items from this mod support effects from SR);\n- Armor Adapt (armor from this mod no longer causes lag with armor adapt installed).\n\nIf you find any issues or bugs or errors, you can report them on the GitHub Issues page, or in the related discussion on Steam Workshop, on the Starbound Forum page, or in the Discord server.\n",
