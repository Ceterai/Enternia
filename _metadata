  "description" : "This mod adds a whole new planet type with it's own biomes, monsters, materials and unique equipment.\nFor the full list of contents, see [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2006558650/2441461920658470681/]this[/url].\n\nThis mod has a [url=https://github.com/Ceterai/Enternia]GitHub page[/url].\nThe full list of changes can be in the changelog file on the GitHub page.\n\nI made this little mod mainly for myself, but decided to share with everybody.\n\nI'm back in Starbound, so 1.3 is coming out soon. I'm not planning much, so maybe in a month or so.\nWhat has been done so far for 1.3:\n- biomes: custom core, erchius underground subbiome;\n- objects: tech decor and poison/electricity hazards for the deep caves and the core;\n- other minor stuff like decorative clothing;\n- changes to ids and descriptions of stuff that you don't have to worry about (like weather names and icons);\n- custom parallax for the main biome;\n- codexes that make more sense.\n\nThis mod doesn't require any other mods to work and should be FU-compatible.\nTabula Rasa compatible.",
