  "description": "I made this mod mainly for myself, but decided to share with everybody.\nThis mod adds a new playable race, 2 new planets with their own biomes, monsters, many hazards and treasure. The mod adds new unique weapons, armor, cosmetics, augments/collars, spawners, codexes, throwables and other equipment.\nAll new content can only be found on those 2 planets, is fairly balanced, and thus doesn't interfere with normal gameplay!\n\nCheck out the mod page for more info. Or, even better, check the mod's Wiki!\n\nWhere to start:\n\n- To explore the worlds added by this mod, try to find new planet types around tier 3+ stars!\n\n- To start progressing in the mod content, craft an Alta Crafting Station! It should be available at the tier 2 Inventor's Table.\n  From there, you'll be able to craft:\n  - mod equipment (armor, weapons, throwables, etc);\n  - other mod crafting tables;\n  - all mod items that can normally be only found through loot (requires max tier).\n  Other crafting tables include:\n  - Alta Constructor for crafting objects/decorations/traps (upgrading to max tier allows you to even craft natural objects and loot tables);\n  - Alta Datacenter for crafting codexes the tell you the lore and/or explain how certain mod items work (highly recommend to read them if you don't have to visit the wiki);\n  - Alta Upgrade Station for upgrading some mod items in exchange for Gheatsyn Shards.\n\nThis mod doesn't require any other mods to work and should be FU-compatible. It also shouldn't conflict with any other mods due to specific id patterns.\n\nSupported Addons:\n\n- Tabula Rasa (most items and objects are available at the table);\n- Spawnable Item Pack (all objects and a lot of items are available here, though less than at Tabula Rasa. I would recommend using max tier Alta Crafting Station, Alta Constructor and Alta Datacenter for all recipes);\n- Equivalent Exchange (all plant-based and non-organic materials can be studied at the Farm Table and the Mine Table respectfully. Nothing fot the Hunt Table);\n- Improved Food Descriptions (proper support for all effects added by this mod);\n- More Planet Info (proper support for all effects, weather and biomes of this mod);\n- True Space (planets added by this mod are able to spawn near True Space stars. Alterash can spawn as a mild/cool planet or satellite, Alterash Prime as a cool/cold planet or satellite);\n- Race Traits (check mod screenshots for stats);\n- Frackin' Races/Frackin' Universe (PARTIAL: no FU BYOS support. If you need it, you can get it here with Alta FU Patch+).\n\nIf you find any issues or bugs or errors, you can report them on the GitHub Issues page, or in the related discussion on Steam Workshop, on the Starbound Forum page.\n",
