This substance is highly viscous and consists of two layers.  \nThe **outer** layer, or the **cryo layer**, is heat-isolation slime that protects the inner layer from low temperatures. This is a precious material that is often used by ^#b0e0fc;altas^reset; in construction.  \nThe **inner** layer, or the **poi layer**, consits of pure slime and is the main part of isoslime.\n\nIsoslime is a subtype of regular ^#7ddcde;slime^reset;.",
