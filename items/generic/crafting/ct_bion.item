  "description" : "A bulletproof piece of composite cloth, mostly made from bion - purified ^#299fc5;bionid^reset;. Pure bion is able to bend well and provide heat retention, while mixes like bionix are hard and can barely bend.",
  "longdescription" : "Encompasses different types of ^#299fc5;bionics^reset; developed by ^#b0e0fc;altas^reset;.\n\nIt's worth noting that altas themselves partially consist of pure bion as well, along with ^#76c7e4;crystals^reset; and ^#8020f0;ionic ferment^reset;, and even ^#2080f0;plasma^reset;, all in relatively small ratios compared to bion.",
  "altaDescription" : "The hardest part is figuring out what compound this is. Hopefully there are markings on it, wouldn't want to brick my gear or mismatch a blueprint.",
