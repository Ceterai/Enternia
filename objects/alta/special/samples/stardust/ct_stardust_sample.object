Celestia has created us, with a purpose, but what is it exactly?.. Just to be... friends? She said it was too sad and lonely on the endless vast of the universe... But I assume there might be more than that behind that smile. Poor Orchid. I hope I can be her friend one day. Just to cheer her up a little. Just a bit. Maybe then her smile won't look so fake anymore. Even if it will make her cry, those will be the tears of happiness.",
