  "description" : "Transforms an area of a planet into a riverside beach. An alta attempt at creating smaller-scale terraformers. Is much more resource consuming and bigger in size than ancient analogs.",
  "longdescription" : "This steppe area is riddled with rivers and underground waters and thus has rich vegetation that you would commonly find in places like these, like thickets of reeds and willow-like trees. ^#b0e0fc;Altas^reset; use this coastal zone for resorts and camping, using the reeds as crafting materials for tents and deck chairs. Underneath the ground you can find many different semi-flooded caves with crystal-clear water and interesting rock formations.\n\nThis place is a home to brightly-colored ^#497c64;verriskoywa^reset; flowers, these swampy plains are full of tall grass and willow-like trees called ^#497c64;gianas^reset;.  \nProfessional chefs often come here in search of a rare spice - ^#497c64;veraltai^reset;, made from petals of ^#497c64;koywa altos^reset;.\n\nUnder the ground there are harmless moonrock stalactites with water from the rivers slowly dripping onto just as harmless moonrock stalagmites, forming dense electrified ponds right under the surface.",
  "altaDescription" : "Riversides are often filled with resorts, beaches and relaxing altas. I wouldn't mind playing with my sisters on the beach from time to time!",
