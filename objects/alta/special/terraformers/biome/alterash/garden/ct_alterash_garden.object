Is much more resource consuming and bigger in size than ancient analogs, and has a long way to go.\n\n^#20f080;Alterash Gardens^reset; are a peaceful prairie on the surface of Alterash planets, filled with grass, colorful flowers and iridescent ^#ffa8e8;prisms^reset; made of crystallized ^#ffa8e8;stardust^reset;. Rare ayaka trees are scattered around a surface, with ripe bright blue ayas hanging among their leaves.  \nThe underground here is filled with bushes and rare ayaka roots.\n\nYou can find these gardens on every ^#20f080;alterash^reset; planet and is likely the first thing you'll see - this mostly plain terrain with little danger around is a great place for landing.\n\nWhat awaits you in the distance? What lies beneath the surface? What hides up high behind those clouds? Time to find out! ^gray;Welcome to Alterash.^reset;",
