  "longdescription" : "^#6f6c66;Astera^reset; is a cluster of various-sized asteroids. Some of them are so convenient, that ^#b0e0fc;altas^reset; have built their space stations on them, as well as numerous ^#6f6c66;Astera Industries^reset;, scattered among the floating rocks, all around ^#ffa8e8;stardust^reset; planets.  \nThese places often feel like small cosmic cities, when inhabitated by altas. When they're not, a no-less magical landscape occurs, full of beautifully shining specs of stardust all around reflecting the sunlight, creating a spectacular light show, also known as ^gray;astera's glow^reset;.",
