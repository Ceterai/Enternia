  "longdescription" : "^#8080f0;Vionostera^reset;, or enchanted land, is an almost magical place full of mystical things, hence the name.  \nBlue fields of dense grass with pink tops of ^#8080f0;blossoming ayakas^reset;, ^#8080f0;enchanted orbs^reset; and rare ^#8080f0;beakseed^reset; bushes showing above the surface.  \nUnder the ground there are glowing ^#8080f0;enchanted bushes^reset;, lighting up the caves with pink bioluminescence.\n\nThis place looks almost magical, even though this kind of view is a somewhat common for the ionized temperate climate.  \nAt its core, this place is an anomaly, caused by high concentration of conflicting energies.\n\nA much rarer variation of this biome is called ^#f080f0;Invertia^reset;.",
