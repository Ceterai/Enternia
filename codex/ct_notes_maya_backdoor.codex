    "Tia thinks that the two of us can handle this, but I'm not as optimistic. Now, that Mira is...

I told Tia that I'll make sure all 'doorways' no longer have an energy source. Obviously, I can't just pretend like I did that, I'll have to remove them for real.
But. Something tells me we'll need someone else's help.
I'll make sure to send an SOS signal to everywhere I can reach without her noticing.

...Please. If you're reading this. The energy sources used by 'doorways' are the same sources still installed in the generators on Crimsash satellites.

Find the generator, charge the backdoor and find us. I'll try to hold her back as long as possible. - C.M."
