    "EDS TECHNOLOGY (ET) DEVELOPMENTS DOCUMENTATION

The goal of this document is to maintain a full list of technology, relevant to and used in development of EDS. All entries are assigned according ids, ordered by registration date and relevant connections to other entries.
In accordance to the document, all ids must be issued in ETN format (thr. CEN-202).",

"Note, that starting with discovery of stardust energy capabilities and the Enternia phenomenon, all Enternia-related technology should be marked as potentially dangerous.",

"ET0, Alterash Technology Reference - ET0 id relates to all AT ids involved in the development of EDS, including regulation and infrastructure systems.

ET1, Elerune Defensive Systems - A compound of systems an protocols establishing automated planetary protection, providing safe conditions for any developments and full lockdown in case of emergency.

ET12, S-Based Energy Generator - Alternative energy source, which extracts energy from enterite, producing great amounts of energy with greater effectiveness than regular C-Based CT's.

ET14, Enternia Sphere - ET12 RM-1 model, 'Enter-Sphere', providing high-voltage energy distribution. Potentional use in further development for rapid energy discharges. Refs: CT27, CT29, CT32, CT33, CT46. Related CEN: CEN-7 protocol.",

"ET19, Enternia Field Emitter - AT2034 of EDS development, atmosphere ionization static field emitter, provides full air ionization in the atmospheric range. Main difference from AT2034 is the integration of ET14 as the energy source that, unlike all previous versions, provides enough power to sustain the system on a planetary level.

ET20, Enternia Terraforming System - AT2176 RM-2 of EDS development, uses ionized air to create an atmosphere for terraforming purposes. Seems to affect solid matters, which relusts in crystallization of moonstone and stardust. Main difference from AT2176 is the integration of ET14 as the energy source that, unlike all previous versions, provides enough power to sustain the system on a planetary level.

ET21, Enternia Stabilizer - AT8206 RM-1 of EDS development, keeps void-related indicators intact and controls the stardust creation system. A negative side effect is generation of stardust off over the planet, resalting in its further crystallization, turning it into prisms. Main difference from AT8206 is the integration of ET14 as the energy source that, unlike all previous versions, provides enough power to sustain the system on a planetary level.",

"ET246, Enternia EPP - 'Enter-EPP'!, is!a!t...n!l%.

ET288 -d!s."
