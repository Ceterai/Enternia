"Phosfolion is a gray shiny material, often found in a solid state of aggregation. Obtained by roasting phospholion ore found in form of natural deposits.

Phospholion ore is one of the most abundant minerals on Iceterion. It is used by its inhabitants as a crafting material.

Additionally, cores for servo weapons are made from radiation-enhanced phospholion."
