  "longdescription" : "The growth mentioned in the report is cryonic algae that forms deep underneath the surface, usually from remains of isoslime residue.",
  "altaDescription" : "I never actually new this side of tavriya nature, if you could call it that. While tavriya does often have different plant-looking growth, most of is usually revealed to be of a different origin.",

    "This report provides further insight into specifics of certain types and variations of tavriya climate, as well as the discovery of Izo-Algae, as part of the Cryocoral Project.

We're continuing to look into ways of possible ways of accquiring cryonic extract from the discovered specimens, and ways to cultivate them to make the process more efficient and scalable.",

"Pure cryonic exctract has proven to be more efficient at certain tasks than another, much more available cryonic - izon.
While doesn't seem to be universally better than izon, the tests and experiments have shown better performance when it comes to creating coolants and ice-polarized energy tools.
However, izon continues to be better at warped containment, general cooling and organic usages, such as in cooking. Unlike pure cryonic extract, izon is alta-safe, which would be a priority in most cases.",

"Currently, the most prominent location of natural habitat for Izo-Algae seems to be in warmer areas of tavriya, where temperature tends to raise just below the melting point of snow during seasonal temperature peaks.

This might deem \"warm tavriya\" zones as uniquely valuable because of this currently precious resource."
