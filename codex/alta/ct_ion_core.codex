    "The core stability has regular fluctuations as usual, and the ion radiation seems to be still so far.

All readings are stable, the ^#202080;ion core^reset; energy will by at its peak in approx. 14 hours.

Monitoring equipment:

- ^#b0e0fc;Alta Lab Amplifier^reset; ID: AIN-35af1f20
- ^#b0e0fc;Alta Lab Terminal^reset; ID: AIC-f4f1904c

"Further report:  
An energy device found during scouting by an ^#f08f20;Arco^reset; scout, codename ^#202080;\"Ion Fortress\"^reset;, as well as a deprecated ^#2080f0;plasma chakram^reset;.  
All findings went to the coordination center.  
No anomalies detected during the scouting, as well as no ^#8080f0;viona^reset; energy this time.

Last time an enchanted item was found, along with a small-size anomaly, which could be a potential threat to the core's stability."
