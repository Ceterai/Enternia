    "^#b0e0fc;Nia cuisine^reset;, or energy cuisine, is popular among sporty altas and makes up a big part of the ^#b0e0fc;Enia Diet^reset;.

Some nia dishes, like ^#b0e0fc;ometonnas^reset;, ^#b0e0fc;zandarm tarts^reset; and ^#b0e0fc;tonna shakes^reset;, don't fall under that category.",

"A great example of that would be ^#b0e0fc;shokkas^reset;. ^#b0e0fc;Shokka^reset; is a sweet meaty satisfying nia stew that is similar in texture to the ^#b0e0fc;blue boil^reset;.
