    "Celestial energy and radiation can very rarely be used as a singular source of essential plant-growing materials. Even still, omniponics show that there can be real usage in that, even if the demand for it is sparse.\nStill, omnipowerful stream-based plant growing is one of the greatest achievements of alta science.",
    "Alta Omni Eco Pods are a the best piece of implementation for this technique as of now, with further developments by several research groups happening in real time."
