    "Thermal plant feeding seemed to be impossible until recently. Even still, it can only be used for a tiny variety of plants, that can survive off of direct energy feeding. These plants often are energy-based, belonging to one of the rarest plant type there are.",
    "Due to energy conversion efficiency, scientists are trying their best to develop new plants, able to produce common resources from sheer energy - multiple research groups interested in this caused a new subprofession to appear - Alta Thermobotanist, or Alta Niaraia."
