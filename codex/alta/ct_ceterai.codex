    "PROJECT 'CETERAI' TECHNOLOGY (CT) DEVELOPMENTS DOCUMENTATION

The goal of this document is to maintain a full list of technology, relevant to and used in development of the project. All entries are assigned according ids, ordered by registration date and relevant connections to other entries.
In accordance to the document, all ids must be issued in CTN format (thr. CEN-202).",
