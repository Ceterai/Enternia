    "We're leaving immediately. There's no point in taking everything, so I'll just take what's most important. Some data will be required for further research.

I won't turn off the EDS to protect what's left. And who knows, maybe someday we'll come back.

Maya made sure that all 35's are missing the energy source, so no one could enter even if they get through the EDS.

I hope we still have a chance. - C.T."
