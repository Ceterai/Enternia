    "Hi there, fellow ^#b0e0fc;alta^reset;! I, Miara, am a grand chef at one of ^#b0e0fc;Alta-1^reset; biggest restaurants and I'm here to get you accustomed with the basics of ^#b0e0fc;alta kitchen^reset; and culture around it!

Desserts make up a large part of alta recipes and most of them are pretty easy to make, making them a great way to start! Iced desserts, tarts, candies and cookies are all good choices for a beginner.

This book provides some of the simpler recipes for you to try out!",

"Common alta recipes are relatively simple, yet just as everything here, a lot of them are reflections of altas and their culture.

The recipes that this ebook showcases are semi-common alta desserts, like ice creams, and tea - a popular type of drinks among altas.

Alta tea has a multitude of recipes, variations and mixes, so this book will only include the most popular ones instead.",
