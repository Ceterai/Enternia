    "Hi again, fellow ^#b0e0fc;alta^reset;! My name is Miara and I am a grand chef at one of ^#b0e0fc;Alta-1^reset; biggest restaurants.  
In this ebook, I want to go in-depth on more advanced recipes that you can learn to become a great cook!

^#b0e0fc;Food^reset; is an important part of ^#b0e0fc;alta culture^reset; and often represents similar concepts and reflects its peculiarities.

Thus, the ingredients you can find in different cuisines, and even cuisines themself, might remind you of certain basic alta concepts.",

"For example, the ^#b0e0fc;runeva cuisine^reset; represents the Runeva triangle concept, found in many corners of alta civilization as a whole, and things like the ^#b0e0fc;Gyera Ordis^reset; and ^#b0e0fc;Iora Gyera Parks^reset;, or the ^#ffa8e8;stardust^reset; energy components, the fundamental part of ^#ffa8e8;Io^reset; herself.

Similarly, most ingredients of the ^#b0e0fc;calin cuisine^reset; are representative of another fundamental part of alta existance - ^#76c7e4;crystals^reset;.",

"^#b0e0fc;Nia cuisine^reset; is representative of energy - an important component of Io and the life on stardust planets and other ^#ffa8e8;Io structs^reset;.

Now, ^#b0e0fc;yava cuisine^reset; relates to the nature and the overwhelming ^#20f080;ceternia^reset; energy within it, the integral part of life as a whole.

These four main cuisines represent the ^#b0e0fc;Alta Quaternion^reset; - a common occurence in alta civilization, that tends to group things in multitudes of 4 - quarter of 16, the hexadecimal system used by altas.",
