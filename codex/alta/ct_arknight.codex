    "According to the ^#60c0fc;Arknight Protocol^reset;, my duties include patrolling, general help and coordination, as well as emergencies and missions.

As a proper ^#60c0fc;arknight^reset;, I should be able to quickly recognize threats and respond to other altas' calls for help.  
On regular patrolling, I should be aware of my surroundings both in above and below, on the ground.  
In case a threat occurs on the ground, I can use the deploy pod, a manual dispatch, or an evamech if I'm in a squad.",

"In case of a threat from above, I can use an AAP (anti-airthreat protection) to neutralize the threat.

On group missions, I should always coordinate with my squad to bring us success.

I should also be aware of general information regarding the region I'm in so I can help lost altas find their home.

Every ^#b0e0fc;alta^reset; matters."
