    "Bionics, or ^#299fc5;bion^reset;-based materials, including ^#299fc5;bion compounds^reset;, are a family of ^#299fc5;bionid^reset;-related variations used mainly by ^#b0e0fc;altas^reset; as armor plating and protective clothing.

Bion is the primary material that makes up majority of any bion connections and variations, the most common of which is the naturally occuring ^#299fc5;bionid ore^reset;. Refining it into ^#299fc5;pure bion^reset; and further reinforcing it into a compound makes it a perfect armoring resource.",

"Different bion compounds behave differently as well. Listed below are popular formulas and their distincting features.

^#299fc5;Pure Bion^reset; - while not as luminescent as the bionid ore it comes from, it is very bendable and adaptable with no shape memory.
Often used for protective clothing, like in the ^#10b4ef;Combat Set^reset; of alta equipment.
Considered a light tier armor.",

"^#299fc5;Bionium^reset; - similar to pure bion in its bending capabilities, it retains strong shape memory to an extent controlled by electricity.
Often used for robotics armor plating, like on ^#10b4ef;Watcher Drones^reset; or ^#10b4ef;Spider Droids^reset;. Considered a medium tier armor.

^#299fc5;Bionix^reset; - a sturdy, less bendable variant, that makes it up in hardness and slight shape memory capabilities.
Often used for in-place objects, like alta lab decorations, and combat tools, for example ^#2080f0;Plasmora^reset;.
Considered a heavy tier armor.",

"^#299fc5;Dianid^reset; - a light-colored armor variant that utilizes diamonds as a secret ingridient. This is the hardest bendable compound yet, but is also quite expensive to make.
Considered a medium tier armor.

Other useful compounds include:
^#299fc5;Bion-2A1^reset;, ^#299fc5;Bion-4^reset;, ^#299fc5;Calonid^reset;, ^#299fc5;Ionic Bion^reset;.

^#299fc5;Biocaloid^reset;, though not a compound, is another bionic worth mentioning, since this is a type of bionic commonly found in alta bodies."
