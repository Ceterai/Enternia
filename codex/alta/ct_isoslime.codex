    "^#7ddcde;Izopoi^reset;, or isoslime, is a generally inedible material that, with proper preparation, can become a great cooking ingredient.

To be clear, even unprepared, izopoi is not inedible in its true sense; instead, it just passes the system with no damage to it whatsoever, but doesn't get properly digested either.

For this reason, this book will explain ways to cook with izopoi to make it as edible and tasty as possible.",

"The easiest way to cook izopoi is to turn it into ^#7ddcde;Izo Jam^reset;.
To do this, you'll need to separate the izo (cryo) layer of the slime from its poi (slime) layer first. This way adding and mixing proper proportions will become much easier.

Izo Jam is a popular cooking ingredient in itself, used in many different cold desserts, for example in ^#7ddcde;Biomix Ice Cream^reset;."
