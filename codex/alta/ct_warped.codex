    "^#9b2d3f;Warped^reset; growth is an uncontrollable, constantly mutating and slowly expanding plant matter.

While mostly harmless by itself, the dangers of warped climate comes from both expansion and other warped-compatible life that appears in it.

It's very hard to control the warped expansion, but it can be contained with certain precautions.",

"Still, its containment is one of primary goals as of right now, since it endangers ^#20f080;yaara groves^reset; it expands on.

The warped growth itself consists of ^#9b2d3f;glow fibres^reset; and ^#9b2d3f;yonnur^reset;.

^#9b2d3f;Yonnur^reset; is a bioluminescent liquid that is often used by altas for illumination, in things like an ^#b0e0fc;Alta Lab Capsule With Yonnur^reset;.",

"In order to properly contain the growth, all glow fibre veins and bulbs containing yonnur need to be properly frozen or curdled.

This can be done via specialized alta devices, or with cryogenic materials like ^#b0e0fc;cryonic extracts^reset; and ^#7ddcde;isoslime^reset;.",

"As for the warped-compatible life, it includes venomous plants like ^#9b2d3f;nivera^reset;, ^#9b2d3f;warped hives^reset;, ^#9b2d3f;warped hive trees^reset; and monsters like ^#9b2d3f;warped flies^reset;, ^#9b2d3f;bruteflies^reset;, ^#9b2d3f;warped sporgus^reset;, ^#9b2d3f;warped anglures^reset;, but it can also contain mostly harmless plants, like ^#9b2d3f;archulins^reset;.

^#9b2d3f;Archulins^reset; are bitter berries that can be used as cooking ingridients for simple alta dishes like ^#9b2d3f;archilibites^reset;."
