    "By astera, ^#b0e0fc;altas^reset; usually mean a cosmic area surrounding any ^#ffa8e8;Io structs^reset;, most commonly ^#20f080;alterash^reset; planets.

More often than not such spaces are filled with asteroids rich on minerals, ^#76c7e4;crystals^reset;, ^#ffa8e8;stardust^reset;, and alien life forms.

That's why it's not uncommon to find different alta industries scattered throughout astera.",

"These industries include ^#b0e0fc;alta space stations^reset; for bypassing ships, mining facilities that gather the minerals and crystals from all around, and research labs where altas perform cosmos-related studies and experiments.
This is where a lot of stardust-related research comes from, as well as research about astera itself, the Io structs and the moon-like nature of ^#20f080;alterash^reset; and ^#8020f0;enterash^reset; planets.",

"Since performing research and other work in such environments is not particularly easy, many astera-based organizations and teams have formed an alliance meant for sharing resources and providing technological help to each other.

This alliance is currently known as Astera Industries, or ^gray;Astera Ordis^reset; for short."
