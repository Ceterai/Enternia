    "Viona energy, or vionia for short, is a magical whyrlpool of energies, that comes together to create a miracle. Each miracle is a surprise, and can be pretty unpredictable, if you're not very careful.

Sometimes silly little altas might get careless and play with vionia and forget about caution. A pretty floating miazma will appear, and start slowly glowing with magic of the unknown.",

"And right when the magic reaches its peak, the miracle will happen! The colorful miazmas will cover enchanted little alta in sparkles and lights, and something about her will change.

She will look at herself in the mirror, and realize that she now has a pair of fluffy animal ears, or shiny fur all over her body! Horns, tails, funny eyes, just about anything could happen!

So be careful, silly altas, and don't play with vionia and tricky miazmas too much!"
