    "A.R.C.O. RESEARCH COMPILATION

Welcome to A.R.C.O. - one of the biggest and efficient alta research and exploration compounds!

Found in Alliana, A.R.C.O. laboratories have expanded throughout many ionic systems since then and are now covering a great number of ^#2080f0;alterash prime^reset; planets.",

"The latest goals of the company were exploring and researching the nature of different ^#76c7e4;crystallic^reset; systems found in alterash prime undergrounds.
Since most types of ^#76c7e4;crystals^reset; in ^#2080f0;esetera^reset; and below exist in hazardous environments, A.R.C.O. presents a new protective gear set - the A.R.C.O. ^#f08f20;Envirosuit^reset;!
Please see appropriate research, descriptions and instructions below.
