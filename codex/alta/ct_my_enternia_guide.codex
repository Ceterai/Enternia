"MOD CONCEPTS AND FACTIONS

^#b0e0fc;Alta^reset;
Altas are an artificial humanoid species that can commonly be found around ^#20f080;alterash^reset; planets. These bionic creatures are primarily focused on crystal-related research.

^#ffa8e8;Io^reset;
Io is a type of celestial environments high on electric charges and ^#ffa8e8;stardust^reset;. This is where planets like ^#20f080;alterash^reset; are usually forming. Altas consider Io to be a its own being, rather than a vague area in space.",

"^#20f080;Yaara^reset;
Yaara Groves are huge underground megaplants, that spread into large disctances and form their own microclimate with different plants and creatures inside.

^#9b2d3f;Warped^reset;
A constantly spreading plant-like matter, that \"warps\" the surroundings it contaminates. Can often be quite poisonous, and, in some cases, bioluminescent.",

"^#8080f0;Enchanted^reset;
Also known as Viona, enchanted areas are anomalous places where different types of energy merge and combine, creating a highly unstable environment.

^#f02020;EDS^reset;
A militaristic alta faction centered around protecting altas against various threats. Lately, something went wrong with their command centers, leading to defensive technology going rogue.",

"^#ffe364;Faradea^reset;
A freedom-loving faction of mercenaries, rarely found in the wild. Unlike most altas, faradea mercs' lifestyle revolves around roaming the plannet, scavenging for treasure.

^#6f6c66;Astera^reset;
The rare asteroids beyond the stardust eva sky, that hide rare, yet powerful treasure.",

"Since altas are a very research-centered species, you will find many scientific alta factions along the way. For example:

- ^#f08f20;A.R.C.O.^reset;
- ^#a7e001;Ghearun^reset;
- ^#0050c0;Hevika Ordis^reset;
- ^#b0e0fc;Tserera^reset;
- ^#8020f0;Neiteru-1^reset;
- ^#20f080;Yava Gyera Ordis^reset;
- ^#2080f0;Project C.T.^reset;

"ALTA SCANNER
