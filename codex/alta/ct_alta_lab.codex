    "Access codes to most of alta laboratories operate according to standardized protocols and principles.

Most often they depend on the direction of the laboratory and the research group using it.

Laboratories focused on the study and production of energy very often have many ^#b0e0fc;energy locks^reset; in addition to the usual protocols, especially if they are locally produced.",

"Such labs, in addition to the usual equipment such as ^#b0e0fc;alta lab capsules^reset;, ^#b0e0fc;alta lab terminals^reset; and ^#b0e0fc;alta lab servers^reset;, are usually filled with special energy equipment such as ^#b0e0fc;alta lab amplifiers^reset;, most often used in the development of terraformers, or ^#b0e0fc;alta lab capsules^reset;, the main purpose of which is most often either to simply contain energy fuel or synthesis of energy in vacuum space.",

"Medical laboratories, on the other hand, most often have a large number of advanced models of ^#b0e0fc;alta lifechambers^reset; and ^#b0e0fc;alta lab beds^reset;, allowing not only to perform dangerous operations, but also to send altas into medical stasis, keeping them alive.
Similar equipment, but for plants, can be found in botanical research gardens - ^#b0e0fc;alta lab eco chambers^reset; designed to support life for specimens that require non-standard conditions.",

"Thus, complexes with similar equipment can be easily found in places where the research industry is concentrated - on the islands of ^#2080f0;esetera^reset;, among ^#6f6c66;astera^reset; asteroids and occasionally near the moderate ^#202080;ion cores^reset; of planets.

Occasionally, general laboratories and research centers can be found on the surface, but such complexes more often than not use other types of equipment.",

"Some scientific companies and organizations use their own developed equipment, such as ^#0050c0;Hevika Ordis^reset; and ^#a7e001;Ghearun^reset;.

In such cases, access and security technologies are based on the company's own protocols, in addition to the mandatory ones.

The calling card of alta labs is considered to be the ^#b0e0fc;alta lab pod^reset; - a standard model used almost everywhere due to its properties."
