    "Taking care of flowers is a fairly distinct process to simple farming or plant growing, as it focuses quite a lot on the blooming stage of the plant, rather then on its ripening of maturing. This is because blooming can be quite a complex process in itself, sometimes requiring professional care to get right.",
    "The high demand on flowers, aside from their beauty, can be explained by the usefulness of its produce - like petals and powder for most plants, but also resources like emulsions, extracts and seeds (for the bloom-seed plants). Some flowers are charished for their mobility - like yaara hunters and aya virmas!",
    "Make sure you have a double-layered pot to keep your plant in. If its roots require light, crystal-sided or transparent pots are recommended, while temperature-sensitive plants prefer multi-layered bion pots instead. Composite pots can provide proper environmental isolation and are mostly used for toxic plants, like aric sporelings."
