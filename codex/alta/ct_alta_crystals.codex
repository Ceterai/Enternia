    "^#ffa8e8;Stardust^reset; ^#ffffff;planets^reset; and cosmic bodies, or ^#ffa8e8;Io Structs^reset;, thrive with a variety of crystals and semi-crystal matters. Even the integral part of ^#ffa8e8;Io^reset; - stardust itself - can be found here in form of ^#ffa8e8;stardust crystals^reset;.

This ^#76c7e4;Crystal Rapture^reset; can be explained by the ^#7733aa;electric^reset; nature of Io Structs, since these ^#76c7e4;crystallic environments^reset; tend to interact with electricity in different ways.  
Currently, alta researchers have discovered a pretty long list of species and subspecies of crystals.",

"The list below contains the main superspecies discovered so far:

- ^#76c7e4;Cal^reset; (Crystals, Common)
- ^#76c7e4;Calin^reset; (Crystal Caves or ^#76c7e4;Calocaves^reset;)
- ^#76c7e4;Calline Prime^reset; (Crystalline, Prime)
- ^#76c7e4;Gheatsyn^reset; (Liquid Crystals)
- ^#76c7e4;Calotorn^reset; (General ^#76c7e4;Geodes^reset;)
- ^#76c7e4;Soneva^reset; (^#76c7e4;Ice Crystals^reset;)
- ^#76c7e4;Statsyn^reset; (^#76c7e4;Stardust Crystals^reset;)
- ^#76c7e4;Bishyn^reset; (Poison Crystals)
- ^#76c7e4;Hevika^reset; (Overcharged Crystals)
- ^#76c7e4;Mical^reset; (Pink Crystals)
- ^#76c7e4;Carel^reset; (^#76c7e4;Crystal Plants^reset;)",

"Altas use these in a variety of ways - from energy managing and building to decorating and even cooking.
Even regular cal is used as glass, energy containers, light sources and more.

Read more on individual crystal species to learn more about them and how they are used by altas."
