    "Once upon a time, there was a broken little star. She saw no meaning in her life and purposelessly wandered across Io not knowing who she is and why she exists.

She knew, that she was made of stardust, and that it's what gives her power, but she didn't know what it is and how it works.

She thought that finding that out would help her understand her purpose.",

"With time, she found others who shared her questions. They came together and one time asked Celestia those questions.

To their surprise, she couldn't really answer it, since she herself was also made of stardust, and to her, they were all her beautiful precious flowers, gifted to her by Io.",

"Unsatisfied with the answer, the little stars began thinking on other ways to find this out.  
\"If only there were more of us...\" - thought one of them - \"then we could explore the world and find out about it more and more, so one day we could find the answer!\"  
And her friends agreed.

So they came to Celestia again, asking if she could help them create more little stars.",

"\"I'm sorry, my little stardust flowers, but I can't. It's not in my powers to create you, I can only find smaller specs and guide them to become you.\"

But when she saw their sad little faces, she decided to do everything she could to help them.
\"I can't create more of you, but I will create some friends for you so they can help you instead.\"

And thus, with the help of Io, altas were born.",

"\"My precious little flowers,\" - she said - \"this is my gift to you. Please be kind to each other and treat them with love and care, like I treat you.\"

\"Thank you, mommy Celestia\" - the stars and altas said, and that's how the story of altas began."
