  "longdescription" : "It seems to be caovered in dried up blue stains. The notes were carefully written by a professional with a passion for gardening, a tiny signature at the back says \"Naya\".\n\n**Naya** is a beautiful plant that growth in wet conditions with slight ionization, with some altas ending up choosing it as their name. Though, **Naya The Gardener** usually says that in her case it's a pure coinsidence.",

    "^#3587ff;Ayaka trees^reset; are generally relatively easy to grow and maintain. This is true for almost all ayaka tree types with small exceptions.  
When it comes to the difference between cultivated and wild ayakas, it's significantly hard to cultivate rare ayaka species, as most of them require very spicific conditions to exist.  
This is also true when it comes to fruitfulness. ^#3587ff;Ayas^reset;, the fruit of ayaka, are very hard to cultivate, thus ^#3587ff;Ayaka Forests^reset; and ^#20f080;Alterash Gardens^reset; remain the main sources.",

"The most common species, or the common ayaka tree, however, is pretty cultivation-friendly and can grow almost anywhere.

Besides, the all-new ^#b0e0fc;alta eco chambers^reset; are able to provide most requirements for even the most rare ayaka species, like ^#3587ff;stardust ayakas^reset;, ^#3587ff;Elin ayakas^reset; and even ^#3587ff;ayaka giants^reset;.",

"When taking care of wild forest ayakas, make sure to be aware of and careful around ^#3587ff;aya virmas^reset; - live poisonous ivy that sometimes grows among ^#3587ff;ayaka bushes^reset;.
While mostly docile, they can get pretty touchy, especially during their mating season.

Their poison is not meant to hurt you as much as immobilize, so be wary to not step on one.",

"Most common uses for ayakas, aside from ayas, come from the ^#3587ff;ayaka wood^reset;.

It's mostly used as a building material for light objects, decorations and as casing for small devices and electronics, like an energy cell, due to good isolation. It's also a good impulse accelerator.

^#3587ff;Ayaka wood^reset; can also be refined into paper, or, in very rare cases, used as a cooking ingredient, primarily due to its nutritious fibres and ayaka sap.",


"^#3587ff;Ayaka sap^reset; is a tingie ionic ferment that has a vast variety of uses among altas. It is a common cooking ingredient, as well as a good connective material and ionic accelerator.  
^#3587ff;Aya Powder^reset; is often used as printing material or a cooking ingredient, and as plasma accelerator.  
Common cooking recipes from ayaka biproducts include: ^#3587ff;Aya Fresh^reset;, ^#3587ff;Bluesweet Punch^reset;, ^#3587ff;Aya Mash^reset;, ^#3587ff;Blue Boil^reset;, ^#3587ff;Aya Ice Cream^reset;, ^#3587ff;Runeva Jam^reset;, ^#3587ff;Baked Aya^reset;, ^#3587ff;Ionic Fresh^reset;, ^#3587ff;Aya Essence^reset;, ^#3587ff;Ionic Essence^reset;, etc."
