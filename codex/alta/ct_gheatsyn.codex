  "contentPages" : [

    "The following protocol is designed to help with and regulate any excavation processes in ^#a7e001;gheatorn^reset; areas, but is also applicable to some extent for areas with similar ground density and ^#76c7e4;crystallic^reset; climate, like ^#a7e001;gheaprism^reset; surfaces and certain ^#f02080;mical^reset; areas.

For the sake of navigation, the protocol is divided into cautional, informational and directive articles.
Please refer to an according coordinator in case of any questions.",

"CAUTIONAL SECTION  
Be aware that the ^#a7e001;gheatsyn^reset; environment you're exposed to is highly unstable.
This includes potential dangers relating to ground movement and natural gheatsyn behavior - ^#a7e001;tsyntex process^reset;,  
Due to a constant, although arguably unlikely threat of avalanches, collapses, or coming in contact with liquid gheatsyn, be sure to always wear designated protective equipment, even when operating inside a mech.",

"Please refer to your coordinator to receive your equipment - the ^#a7e001;Ghearun M1 Set^reset;.",

"INFORMATIONAL SECTION  
All equipment is made with power-materials designed to withstand the environment and excessive pressure.
It is also important to note that most ^#a7e001;ghearun^reset; equipment operates on extracted gheatsyn energy, decreasing overall fingerprint of the ordis and helping the cause.  
This can be seen in combat tool advances in the general tech sphere - examples being the ^#a7e001;Tsyntex^reset; blaster and the ^#a7e001;Gheablade^reset;.",

"This concept also makes it easier to perform excavations in environments with matching energy types.",

"DIRECTIVE SECTION

Be sure to follow all on-site guidelines and act on a coordinator's demand. Do not use work-related equipment without or against designation.

For purposes of any large excavation, use a ^#a7e001;Gheatsyn Droid^reset;, provided by the site or according lab.

All excavations should only be permitted after appropriate planning and geo-scanning."
