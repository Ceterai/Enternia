    "The sky above ^#20f080;alterash^reset; always sparkled with a mysterious starry glow.

No matter when you raise your head, it always seems as if above you, high in the sky, there is an endless, crystal-clear ocean, full of coral caramel reefs, beautiful clots of sugar foam and magical, distant dreams and wishes.",

"Many altas are familiar with the desire to get out into the quiet ^#20f080;alterash gardens^reset;, lie down in the grass covered with ^#ffa8e8;stardust^reset;, and, carefreely looking at the sky, dream about anything at all.",

"After all, somewhere up there, in the distance, brave heavenly guardians fly behind the clouds and protect sisters in trouble!

And even further, on asteroids, great alta scientists are developing advanced technologies and moving forward the progress of the entire civilization!

And behind the asteroids, even further, fearless and free ^#b0e0fc;spacedrifters^reset; plow through space itself!",

"And somewhere out there, among the stars, ^#ffa8e8;Celestia^reset; wanders, lovingly caring for each alta.
And farthest from all, in every star, around it and everywhere, there is ^#ffa8e8;Io^reset; herself, quietly observing the world and the passage of time.

\"Who but her could make my wish come true? Please, help me, dear Io!\" - silly alta thinks, closing her eyes, and, filled with determination and good mood, goes on about her day."
