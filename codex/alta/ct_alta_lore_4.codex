    "Alta research has come a long way. From stardust, to crystals, to nature, to culture, to oceans, to space.

They have created cities, laboratories, mines, factions, companies, even their own subspecies, and even their own enemies.

They've come a long way, so long that a lot of them forgot their original purpose.",

"They've become their own thing, with each alta finding her purpose the same way as the ones that came before them.

What does the future hold for them? Only the time will show.
