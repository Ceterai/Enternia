    "The energy mine is a separate part of object 17, going 20 levels underground. It produces energy mixtures and an alien material - phospholion.

The mine is divided into three parts: Warehouse, Energy Mine and Phospholion Mine.

The phospholion mine is divided into 16 levels, the 16th level is not used and is considered abandoned.",

"Phospholion is a gray shiny material, often found in a solid state of aggregation. Obtained by smelting phospholion ore found in form of natural deposits.

Phospholion ore is one of the most abundant minerals on Iceterion. It is used by its inhabitants as a crafting material.

Additionally, cores for servo weapons are made from radiation-enhanced phospholion."
