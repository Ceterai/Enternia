    "Altas are proud of their space construction industry. Spaceships of all sizes and purposes, divided by categories, models and types.

Prowling the expanses of space over long distances, for short flights, for trade, for recreation.

Space stations, starships, cruisers and even the ^#b0e0fc;Al'deron^reset; mothership are the pride of many ^#b0e0fc;alta architects^reset; and ^#b0e0fc;alta scientists^reset;.",

"All ships, as is customary among altas, are subject to their own general standards and protocols.

Both in the form of communication rules and designations, and in the form of requirements for equipment and technologies.

So, in the case of any space mechanisms, the main conditions are always air-tightness, certain levels of reliability and stability, convenience and modularity.",

"Many parts of a typical alta spaceship can exist on their own, rather than as an integral part of the ship itself.

Good examples of such part technologies would be ^#b0e0fc;alta ship shelves^reset;, ^#b0e0fc;alta ship tables^reset;, and even ^#b0e0fc;alta ship beds^reset; with protective screens.",

"If air-tight, many ship devices can continue to operate in any conditions - both underwater and in the vacuum of space. This includes both ^#b0e0fc;alta ship terminals^reset; and the simplest ^#b0e0fc;alta ship lamps^reset;.

But the main example of tightness and reliability are ^#b0e0fc;alta ship gateways^reset; - massive blast-proof structures that can keep most problems on the other side.",

"In the case of cargo ships, the main objects on board will be the ^#b0e0fc;alta ship containers^reset; - sealed pods with many fastenings and protective mechanisms.

Although regular ^#b0e0fc;alta ship pods^reset; are also suitable for carrying cargo, containers provide additional protection and greater capacity due to the ease of manual handling - containers are designed specifically for operating cargo-carrying mechanisms, while pods are designed for direct use by altas."
