    "This doc describes ways to distinguish edible, safe, toxic and poisonous ^#3baf2f;arics^reset;.

As aric shrooms don't have a standardized genome due to extensive rate and size of mutations, it can be hard to know whether or not a particular aric is safe to eat or even be around.",

"Let's start with spores. If you're able to see them at all, this might not be a good sign to begin with.
However, if you're able to determine that they're coming from capsule-like appendages or are too big to enter your system, they're not a threat and are likely edible.",

"If an aric's presense looks very unappealing and defensive, chances are it's entirely edible. Dangerous types of aric generally have glowing parts and/or defensive patterns like spikes or false crystals.

As an example, small ^#3baf2f;agaranics^reset; are mostly edible, while most ^#3baf2f;kodorrics^reset; are not."
