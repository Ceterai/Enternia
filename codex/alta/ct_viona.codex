    "Hi, sis!! Wanna throw a party together?!

My name is Cristia, and I'm the partyleader of a viona alta corfal for viona-affected altas!  
Our caretaker, Kona, decided to help us organize a party, so I decided to invite everyone to it via these invitations, so we can all hand out together!

Kona is a little worried, but she also says that viona doesn't spread from alta to alta, so I think it should be alright!",

"Hope you will come!!

Can't wait to see you,  
Cristia the Magician Girl «

P.S. If you do come, I'll let you pet my fluffy tail, hehe ^^ (I got it because of viona, and it's really cool!) «"
