    "There's a powerful virmamancer living in the woods, the legends say she rules over all virmas in those woods and they do anything she wants on just a single command.

Not many know, but the virmamancer is actually just a kind litlle alta gardener, who loved growing and studying plants so much she was able to find a common language even with the wild virmas in the forest.",

"They quickly became great friends, and were able to live together despite seemingly ominous language barriers."
