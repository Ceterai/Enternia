    "^#b0e0fc;Runeva cuisine^reset; is based on the triad of commonly found alta fruits - ^#3587ff;aya^reset;, ^#ff3f5a;gil^reset; and ^#80f020;tsay^reset;. Together, these three ingredients are able to produce a vast variety of tastes and textures.

Something as simple as a ^#b0e0fc;runeva assorti^reset; can have different feelings to it depending on ratios and preparation methods.",

"This book is meant to describe and help with the most popular runeva dishes to date.

More complicated examples, like ^#b0e0fc;Gil Tarts^reset;, ^#b0e0fc;Soyi^reset;, ^#b0e0fc;Aya Prime^reset;, ^#b0e0fc;Green Bites^reset;, ^#b0e0fc;Gil Seed Cookies^reset;, ^#b0e0fc;Powder Chip Cookies^reset;, ^#b0e0fc;Tsay-Gil Jam^reset;, ^#b0e0fc;Alterash Breeze^reset; and ^#b0e0fc;Allibanas^reset; will be looked into in the next issue of the book.",

"^#b0e0fc;Runeva Assorti^reset; is similar to the aya-tsay ^#b0e0fc;assorti^reset;, except it includes slightly fermented gil covers and aya-boiled dried tsays to add to their sweetness. Usually all of this gets in slices and layed out in triplets.",

"^#b0e0fc;Gil Tarts^reset; are sweet gil desserts, that involve the gil pulp with no seeds. Instead, the seeds are sprinkled on top and mashed to add to the bottom cover. Tarts as a type of desserts were initially brought in by outsiders, but have slowly found their popularity among some altas.",

"^#b0e0fc;Soyi^reset; is a popular alta dessert that consists of ^#b0e0fc;baked aya^reset; & gil powder covered in gil oil and some ^#8020f0;ionic ferment^reset;.

^#b0e0fc;Aya Prime^reset; is a semi-baked boiled aya, mashed and put back into its cover, creating an illusion of a regular alta. This is often used as a surprise dish or as a party trick.",

"^#b0e0fc;Green Bites^reset; are cut dried tsays presented as chips. The complexity of the recipe varies from place to place, but home-made bites can be pretty easy to make.

^#b0e0fc;Gil Seed Cookies^reset; and ^#b0e0fc;Powder Chip Cookies^reset; are pretty self-explanatory in their meaning, but can get a bit tedious to bake alone.

^#b0e0fc;Tsay-Gil Jam^reset; is a pretty bitter yet soft jam that sticks well to many dishes and gives them a nice aftertaste.",

"^#b0e0fc;Alterash Breeze^reset; is a refreshing drink that smells similar to ^#20f080;blossoming ayaka valleys^reset; found on ^#20f080;alterash^reset; planets.

^#b0e0fc;Allibanas^reset; are small dishes named after ^#b0e0fc;Alliana^reset;. They're served warm and are meant to be eaten right away."
