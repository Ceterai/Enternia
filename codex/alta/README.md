This folder contains all codex definitions for the alta species.

## Types

Alta codexes come in three different types:

- **Datamass** - compact devices containing various information;
- **Ebook** - electronic holographic devices that contain information in an easily-readable form;
- **Paper** - information printed on regular paper, usually made from ayaka wood.

Each codex item has an appropriate item tag to indicate that, as it is used for assigning a pickup radio message.
