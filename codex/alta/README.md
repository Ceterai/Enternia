# Alta Codex

> Main page: [Alta Species](https://github.com/Ceterai/Enternia/wiki/Alta)

This folder contains all codex definitions for the alta species.

Each `.codex` file here is a codex definition that includes both the codex entry itself, and the related codex item that contains the entry.

## Types

Alta codexes come in three different types:

- **Datamass** - compact devices containing various information;
- **Ebook** - electronic holographic devices that contain information in an easily-readable form;
- **Paper** - information printed on regular paper, usually made from ayaka wood. Uses a `docs` tag.

Each codex item has an appropriate item tag to indicate that, as it is used for assigning a pickup radio message.
