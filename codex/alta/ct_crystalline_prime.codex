  "longdescription" : "The ebook goes over the concept of primification, which is the process of amplifying the energy or power within an entity by releasing its capabilities. It also describes crystalline prime as a charged crystalline environment.",

    "Primification is the process of amplifying the energy or power within an entity by releasing its capabilities.\n\nAltas call certain things \"Prime\" whenever they enter their true or enhanced form.\n\nThus, ^#c1dfae;Crystalline Prime^reset; is an energy-enhanced ^#c1dfae;Crystalline^reset; environment, full of charged crystalline bushes.",
    "The process can result in the growth of large, powerful crystals. These can be harvested for their energy and used in various applications, including energy storage and weaponry.\n\nThe process of primification can also lead to the development of new crystalline species, which can have unique properties and abilities.",
    "This phenomenon can occur naturally on terraformed moonlike planets, or on similar Io structs like alterash prime planets.\n\nMore information is available in the ^#b0e0fc;Altas & Crystals^reset; database, since crystalline is a ^#76c7e4;calin^reset; subtype.",
    "...The ebook ends with a large list of references to various crystalline prime-related topics, including the properties of different types of crystals, their uses in technology and energy production, and their role in the ecosystem of crystalline prime environments."
