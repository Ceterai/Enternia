    "Primification is the process of amplifying the energy or power within an entity by releasing its capabilities.
    
    Altas call certain things \"Prime\" whenever they enter their true or enhanced form.
    
    Thus, ^#c1dfae;Crystalline Prime^reset; is an energy-enhanced ^#c1dfae;Crystalline^reset; environment, full of charged crystalline bushes.",
    
    "This phenomenon can occur naturally on terraformed moonlike planets, or on similar Io structs like alterash prime planets.
    
    More information is available in the ^#b0e0fc;Altas & Crystals^reset; database, since crystalline is a ^#76c7e4;calin^reset; subtype."
