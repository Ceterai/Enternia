    "EDS TECHNOLOGY (ET) DEVELOPMENTS DOCUMENTATION

The goal of this document is to maintain a full list of technology, relevant to and used in development of EDS. All entries are assigned according ids, ordered by registration date and relevant connections to other entries.
In accordance to the document, all ids must be issued in ETN format (CEN-202).",

"ET0, Enternia Defensive System - Enternia-related project establishing planetary protection for the time of the project development, providing safe conditions for the development. All EDS-related developments are marked as Enter-technology (ET, thr. CEN-7).

ET1, S-Based Energy Generator - Alternative energy source, which extracts energy from Stardust, producing great amounts of energy with greater effectiveness than regular C-Based CT's.

ET14, Enter-Sphere - ET3 RM-1 model, providing high-voltage energy distribution. Potentional use in further development for rapid energy discharges. Refs: CT27, CT29, CT32, CT33, CT46. Related CEN: CEN-7 protocol.

ET19, Enternia Field Emitter - ET19 EDS development, atmosphere ionization static field emitter, provides full air ionization in the atmospheric range.

ET20, Enternia Terraforming System - ET19 RM-1 EDS development, uses ionized air to create an atmosphere for terraforming purposes. Seems to affect solid matters, which relusts in crystallization of moonstone and stardust.

ET21, Enternia Stabilizer - ET19 RM-2 EDS development, keeps void-related indicators intact and controls the stardust creation system. A negative side effect is generation of stardust off over the planet, resalting in its further crystallization, turning it into prisms.",

"ET246, Enter-EPP - t...n!l%.

ET288 -d!s."
