Alta:

- Alta Scanner now displays the item/object author, if it was set within the item's config or parameters;
- alta armor and clothing now supports Futara's Dragon Pixel Full Bright Shader;
- added upgrades to the Security Set.

Translation:

- moved drone (`_drone`) spawner items from `/items/active/unsorted/alta/spawner/` root to `/items/active/unsorted/alta/spawner/drones/` subdirectory;
- moved drone (`_droid`) spawner items from `/items/active/unsorted/alta/spawner/` root to `/items/active/unsorted/alta/spawner/droids/` subdirectory;

  - `/items/armors/alta/tier4/security/legwear/ct_alta_security_legwear.legs`;
  - `/items/armors/alta/tier4/security/pack/ct_alta_security_pack.back`.
