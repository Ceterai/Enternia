An artifical species of humanoids, primarily found on ^#b0e0fc;alterash^reset; planets and their [[ subtypes|Alterash#difficulty ]]. The main focus of their decentralized society is research and exploration with purpose of technological advancement, as well as entertainment and quality of life improvement.

Due to their partial resistance to electricity, altas mainly reside on planets with highly ionized atmosphere to avoid unwanted conflicts with other races and be able to do their research in peace and privacy.
Unfortunately, a failed series of experiments that led to creation of **kaiters** and other threats caused altas to invest into development of a number of combat and security technology, and in some cases even relocate their numerous laboratories and entire facilities away from surface.

Most of the alta research is based on studying ^#b0e0fc;stardust^reset; and the types of energy it provides - ^#b0e0fc;ceternia^reset;, ^#b0e0fc;alternia^reset; and ^#b0e0fc;enternia^reset;.
The second one being most common energy source on alterash planets, and the most balanced in terms of power and safety, altas often use alternia energy as their main source of electricity and power (see ^#b0e0fc;alta technology^reset;).

## Lore

For more information on the history of altas as a species, check out an Alta History series of codexes:

- ^#b0e0fc;Alta History I^reset;
- ^#b0e0fc;Alta History II^reset;
- ^#b0e0fc;Alta History III^reset;
- ^#b0e0fc;Alta History IV^reset;

These codexes can be found in random alta pods of specific tiers, alta history I - in tier 4 pods, II - in tier 3 pods and so on.

### Culture

Alta culture is based around entertainment and healthy lifestyle. Due to the fine-grained craftmanship of their brains and artificially standardized perception there are almost to no conflicts in their society, which has led to cultural stagnation and conservation.
The "light and simple" architectural style, as well as furniture design and clothing style commonly used by altas is called **Arcolar**, and is considered the main style for all governmental infrastructure.

#### Crystals

The lives of altas revolve heavily around <img src="https://starbounder.org/mediawiki/images/3/31/Crystal.png" width="12" height="16"/> [[ crystals|Calin#crystals ]]. It's unknown exactly why, but the main theories is that since altas were created with the help of stardust, an inherently crystallic material, or simply because crystals are an abundant resource available to altas in all shapes and sizes.

There's a codex that describes this connection in-depth: ^#b0e0fc;Altas & Crystals^reset;

#### Food

> Main pages: ^#b0e0fc;Food^reset;

Mostly plant-based meals, made from fruits, crops and spices that can be found on alterash planets. Although limited in choice of ingridients, altas have created a giant number of recipes with great variety of flavors and aethtetics.

The most common types of dishes and drinks are **tea**, **freshes**, non-alcoholic **cocktails**, full-course **meals**, **soups**, **motsus**, which are soup-like easy tonna-based meals, and, obviously, **cakes**.

There are four main **cuisines** that are prominent among altas.
Mostly dependant on the choice of ingredients, dishes of the same cuisine often have similar effects.

Check out the ultimate ^#b0e0fc;Alta Culinary Guide^reset; for more information on the cooking culture of altas.

There's also an ^#b0e0fc;Alta Chef's Guide^reset; for advanced recipes, that provides an insight into alta cooking history.

##### Runeva

A cuisine mostly based on three ingredients found in great abundance all over alterash planets - ^#b0e0fc;aya^reset;, ^#b0e0fc;gil^reset; and ^#b0e0fc;tsay^reset;.  
These dishes often improve **movement and stamina** and other related parameters.

Check out the ^#b0e0fc;Runeva Cuisine Book^reset; for more information.

##### Calin

A crystal-based cuisine consisting primarily of ^#b0e0fc;gheatsyn^reset; crystals and different rare edible <img src="https://starbounder.org/mediawiki/images/f/f2/Crystal_Plant.png" width="13" height="12"/> [crystal plants](https://starbounder.org/Crystal_Plant).
The effects of these dishes often include slight **luminescence and thorns**, but can also cause brief ^#b0e0fc;crystal poison^reset; if underprepared.

Check out the ^#b0e0fc;Calin Cuisine Book^reset; for more information.

##### Nia

Produce full of ionic energy makes up most of nia cuisine ingredients, like ^#b0e0fc;tonna^reset;, ^#b0e0fc;ionic ferment^reset;, etc.
The effects are as expected - increased **energy and energy regen** and the like.

Check out the ^#b0e0fc;Nia Cuisine Book^reset; for more information.

##### Yava

A purely herb-based cuisine that takes advantage of numerous vitamin-high plants that grow on alterash planets, like ^#b0e0fc;yaara^reset; and ^#b0e0fc;koywa^reset;.
Main effects are **health improvement and regeneration**.
