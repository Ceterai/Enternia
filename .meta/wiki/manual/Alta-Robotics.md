# Alta Robotics

> Main page: [Alta Technology](https://github.com/Ceterai/Enternia/wiki/Alta#technology)

These mostly include drones and droids, as well as their uncommon and rare variants.
These robots often contain small energy sources and electronics, which they might drop on explosion along with the materials they're made from.

## Classification

Alta robotics are classified by sizes, tiers and uses.

Size classification includes:

- **Class 1 Robotics** - smaller drones and droids, designed for simpler tasks or lesser sets of function, with higher mobility;
- **Class 2 Robotics** - androids, bigger drones and droids with more complex set s of functions and arsenals;
- **Class 3 Robotics** - mega structures and integrated AI systems with the biggest reach and the most complex sets of functions.

Tier classification follows the standard [Alta Tier System](https://github.com/Ceterai/Enternia/wiki/Alta#tier-system) and includes:

- **Tier 1 Robotics** - casual and research lightweight drones and droids, like personal companions and science drones;
- **Tier 2 Robotics** - robotics with additional ^#b0e0fc;titanium^reset;-based armor layers, usually basic security;
- **Tier 3 Robotics** - reinforced robotics, primarily made from ^#b0e0fc;bion compounds^reset; or ^#b0e0fc;EDS armor^reset;;
- **Tier 4 Robotics** - advanced robotics with composite armor layers.

### Drones

> Full list of drones: [[ Monsters: Drones|Monsters#robotic-monsters ]]

Alta drones are relatively small flying robots designed to perform specific tasks, like exploring, analysing and sometimes attacking dangerous targets.

Some of the drones, like scout or security ones, are peaceful by default.
