![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/active/alta/loot/biome/ct_faradea_loot.png) **Faradea** is a large organized group of [[ alta ]] mercenaries recognized mainly by **yellow straps** on their uniforms and equipment.

**Faradea Mercs** don't have a clear unanimous goal or mission, and thair main occupations is whatever they were hired for.
In other cases, mercs can be found all over alterash planets scavenging the are in search of treasure and adventures.

The main enemy of faradea mercs, aside from [[ kaiters|Kaiter ]], is [[ EDS ]]. EDS acts as both a big competitor and an all-present militaristic force, whos goals don't always align with those of Faradea.

The relationship towards any other altas is mostly neutral - it always depends on each individual group and the job.

#### Legends

Some of the most prominent and powerful faradea mercs call themselves Legends - these profound altas are often leaders of top-rank squads, or unbeatable loners respected by all faradea mercs.
As expected, Legends are often **well-equipped** and can pose a **significant threat**.
Some of the Legends were even seen competing in the kaiter-hosted [[ Gharmatai|Kaiter#Gharmatai ]].

### Attitude Towards The Player
