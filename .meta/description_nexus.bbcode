[list=1]
[*]Doesn't require any other mods to work;
[*]Should be FU-compatible;
[*]The mod uses regular Starbound folder structure so should be easy to navigate and integrate with;
[*]All IDs added by the mod have a [font=Courier New]ct_[/font] prefix to make it impossible to conflict with IDs from other mods;
[*]The mod tries to explore somewhat unusual concepts with unique names so there should be little to no idea overlap;

[size=6]Conclusion[/size]
I made this little mod mainly for myself, but decided to share with everybody.
It was originally only on Steam Workshop and GitHub, but since I've decided to release a 2.4 version, I thought it would be a good idea to finally share it here as well.[url='https://community.playstarbound.com/resources/my-enternia-removed-content.6282/']
