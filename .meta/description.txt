I made this mod mainly for myself, but decided to share with everybody.
This mod adds a new playable race, 2 new planets with their own biomes, monsters, many hazards and treasure. The mod adds new unique weapons, armor, cosmetics, augments/collars, spawners, codexes, throwables and other equipment.
All new content can only be found on those 2 planets, is fairly balanced, and thus doesn't interfere with normal gameplay!

Check out the mod page for more info. Or, even better, check the mod's Wiki!

Where to start:

- To explore the worlds added by this mod, try to find new planet types around tier 3+ stars!

- To start progressing in the mod content, craft an Alta Crafting Station! It should be available at the tier 2 Inventor's Table.
  From there, you'll be able to craft:
  - mod equipment (armor, weapons, throwables, etc);
  - other mod crafting tables;
  - all mod items that can normally be only found through loot (requires max tier).
  Other crafting tables include:
  - Alta Constructor for crafting objects/decorations/traps (upgrading to max tier allows you to even craft natural objects and loot tables);
  - Alta Datacenter for crafting codexes the tell you the lore and/or explain how certain mod items work (highly recommend to read them if you don't have to visit the wiki);
  - Alta Upgrade Station for upgrading some mod items in exchange for Gheatsyn Shards.

This mod doesn't require any other mods to work and should be FU-compatible. It also shouldn't conflict with any other mods due to specific id patterns.

Supported Addons:

- Tabula Rasa (most items and objects are available at the table);
- Spawnable Item Pack (all objects and a lot of items are available here, though less than at Tabula Rasa. I would recommend using max tier Alta Crafting Station, Alta Constructor and Alta Datacenter for all recipes);
- Equivalent Exchange (all plant-based and non-organic materials can be studied at the Farm Table and the Mine Table respectfully. Nothing fot the Hunt Table);
- Improved Food Descriptions (proper support for all effects added by this mod);
- More Planet Info (proper support for all effects, weather and biomes of this mod);
- True Space (planets added by this mod are able to spawn near True Space stars. Alterash can spawn as a mild/cool planet or satellite, Alterash Prime as a cool/cold planet or satellite);
- Race Traits (check mod screenshots for stats);
- Frackin' Races/Frackin' Universe (PARTIAL: no FU BYOS support. If you need it, you can get it here with Alta FU Patch+).

If you find any issues or bugs or errors, you can report them on the GitHub Issues page, or in the related discussion on Steam Workshop, on the Starbound Forum page.
