# Alta Humanoid

> Main page: [Alta Species](https://github.com/Ceterai/Enternia/wiki/Alta)

This folder contains humanoid configuration for the alta species.

## Body Types

While playable alta subspecies all have ~~female~~ feminine body types, this folder also contains `malehead.png` for proper quest displays.

## Horns

The `horns` folder contains currently unused horns.

## Emotes

The facial animations on kaiteras (the altas with block eyes) can be a bit broken due to how Starbound renders emotes.
