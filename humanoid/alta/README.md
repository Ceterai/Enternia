# Alta Humanoid

> Main page: [Alta Species](https://github.com/Ceterai/Enternia/wiki/Alta)

This folder contains humanoid configuration for the alta species.

## Body Types

While playable alta subspecies all have ~~female~~ feminine body types, this folder also contains `malehead.png` for proper quest displays and `malebody.png` for possible compatability with other mods.

Other than that, currently this species only defines 2 feminine gender options - altaya and kaitera.

> **Note:** this might change in the future, if the alta species will need to fit more than 2 variations. Currently, only altaya and kaitera variations are playable, which might change with introduction of kaiters, alters and altaris.

## Horns

The `horns` folder contains currently unused horns.

## Emotes

The facial animations on kaiteras (the altas with block eyes) can be a bit broken due to how Starbound renders emotes.
