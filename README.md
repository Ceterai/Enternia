## Description

I made this little mod mainly for myself, but decided to share with everybody.  
Doesn't require any other mods to work and should be FU-compatible.  
Tabula Rasa compatible.

### Where to start

To explore the worlds added by this mod, try to find new planet types around tier 3+ stars!

To start progressing in the mod content, craft an [Alta Crafting Station](https://github.com/Ceterai/Enternia/wiki/Alta-Crafting-Station)! It should be available at the inventor's table.  
From there, you'll be able to craft:

- mod equipment (armor, weapons, throwables, etc);
- other mod crafting tables;
- all mod items that can normally be only found through loot (requires tier 6).

Other crafting tables include:

- [Alta Constructor](https://github.com/Ceterai/Enternia/wiki/Alta-Constructor) for crafting objects/decorations/traps (upgrading to tier 6 allows you to even craft natural objects and loot tables);
- [Alta Datacenter](https://github.com/Ceterai/Enternia/wiki/Alta-Datacenter) for crafting codexes the tell you the lore and/or explain how certain mod items work (highly recommend to read them so you don't have to visit the wiki);
- [Deprecation Station](https://github.com/Ceterai/Enternia/wiki/Deprecation-Station) is a tiny crafting table that allows you to convert deprecated items/objects to new ones, or exchange Perfectly Generic Items for different presents.

### Screenshots

You can view screenshots on the [Steam page of the mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2006558650).

## Contents

There's a [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/Ceterai/Enternia/wiki) with a semi-full list of contents now!

### Compatability

1. The mod uses a regular Starbound folder structure so should be easy to navigate and integrate with;
1. All IDs added by the mod have a `ct_` prefix to make it impossible to conflict with IDs from other mods;
1. The mod tries to explore somewhat unusual concepts with unique names so there should be little to no idea overlap;
1. Doesn't require any other mods to work;
1. Should be FU-compatible;
1. Tabula Rasa compatible.
