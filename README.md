### Planet

**Ionized Air** - planet hazard effect (like Deadly Cold on arctic stars). Periodically damages the player if they have no energy left. Time between hits allows the energy to regen, so don't worry about it too much. The effect can be completely blocked with Enter-EPP.  
**Ionized Rain/Storm** - like regular Rain/Storm, but additionally damages the player and non-immune npcs with electric damage. Can be completely blocked with Enter-EPP.  
**Immune mobs** - almost every mob on the planet is immune to the electric status effects (except Static Field).
