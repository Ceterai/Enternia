<h1 align="center">My Enternia</h1>

I made this little mod mainly for myself, but decided to share with everybody.  
This mod adds a new species - ![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/interface/title/ct_alta_altaya.png) [Alta](https://github.com/Ceterai/Enternia/wiki/Alta), 2 new planets with their own biomes, monsters, many hazards and treasure. The mod adds new unique weapons, armor, cosmetics, augments/collars, spawners, codexes, throwables and other equipment.  
All new content **can only be found on those 2 planets**, is fairly balanced, and thus doesn't interfere with normal gameplay!  
Check out the end of the description for a **rundown of new content**. Or, even better, check out the official **Wiki**!

## Where to start

To explore the worlds added by this mod, try to find new planet types around tier 3+ stars!

To start progressing in the mod content, craft an ![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/objects/alta/crafting/crafting_station/icon1.png) [Alta Crafting Station](https://github.com/Ceterai/Enternia/wiki/Alta-Crafting-Station)! It should be available at the tier 2 Inventor's Table.  
From there, you'll be able to craft:

- mod equipment (armor, weapons, throwables, etc);
- other mod crafting tables;
- all mod items that can normally be only found through loot (requires max tier).

Other crafting tables include:

- ![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/objects/alta/crafting/constructor/icon1.png) [Alta Constructor](https://github.com/Ceterai/Enternia/wiki/Alta-Constructor) for crafting objects/decorations/traps (upgrading to max tier allows you to even craft natural objects and loot tables);
- ![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/objects/alta/crafting/datacenter/icon.png) [Alta Datacenter](https://github.com/Ceterai/Enternia/wiki/Alta-Datacenter) for crafting codexes the tell you the lore and/or explain how certain mod items work (highly recommend to read them so you don't have to visit the wiki);
- ![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/objects/alta/crafting/upgrade_station/icon1.png) [Alta Upgrade Station](https://github.com/Ceterai/Enternia/wiki/Alta-Upgrade-Station) for upgrading some mod items in exchange for ![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/throwables/ct_gheatsyn_shard.png) [Gheatsyn Shards](https://github.com/Ceterai/Enternia/wiki/Gheatsyn-Shard).

## Contents

There's a [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/Ceterai/Enternia/wiki) with full list of contents and extensive information on each resource!

### Screenshots

You can view screenshots on the [Steam page of the mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2006558650).

### Compatability

1. Doesn't require any other mods to work;
1. Should be FU-compatible.

#### Incompatible

Having these mods doesn't crash the game, but using them with altas will not work.

Temporary partially **incompatible** with [Armor Adapt](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2601606862) - using armors from this mod with it will cause lag.  
Temporary partially **incompatible** with [NpcSpawner+](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=895140470) - use [this patch](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3250490837) if you want to create alta npcs with it.

- [Scripted Artificial Intelligence Lattice (Customisable A.I.!)](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=947429656) (adds 4 A.I. chips that modify S.A.I.L. with alta ship A.I. features and makes alta S.A.I.L. compatible with chips) - if you only want the chips and not the rest of the mod - use this instead: [Alta A.I.

1. All IDs added by the mod have a `ct_` prefix to make it impossible to conflict with IDs from other mods;
