## Description

I made this little mod mainly for myself, but decided to share with everybody.  
Doesn't require any other mods to work and should be FU-compatible.  
Tabula Rasa compatible.

### Where to start

To explore the worlds added by this mod, try to find new planet types around tier 3+ stars!

To start progressing in the mod content, craft an [[Alta Crafting Station]]! It should be available at the inventor's table.  
From there, you'll be able to craft:

- mod equipment (armor, weapons, throwables, etc);
- other mod crafting tables;
- all mod items that can normally be only found through loot (requires tier 6).

Other crafting tables include:

- [[Alta Constructor]] for crafting objects/decorations/traps (upgrading to tier 6 allows you to even craft natural objects and loot tables);
- [[Alta Datacenter]] for crafting codexes the tell you the lore and/or explain how certain mod items work (highly recommend to read them so you don't have to visit the wiki);
- [[Deprecation Station]] is a tiny crafting table that allows you to convert deprecated items/objects to new ones, or exchange Perfectly Generic Items for different presents.

### Screenshots

You can view screenshots on the [Steam page of the mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2006558650).
