# My Enternia

I made this little mod mainly for myself, but decided to share with everybody.  
This mod adds a new race, 2 new planets with their own biomes, monsters, many hazards and treasure. The mod adds new unique weapons, armor, cosmetics, augments/collars, spawners, codexes, throwables and other equipment.  
All new content **can only be found on those 2 planets**, is fairly balanced, and thus doesn't interfere with normal gameplay!  
Check out the end of the description for a **rundown of new content**. Or, even better, check out the official **Wiki**!

[>>> OFFICIAL WIKI <<<](https://github.com/Ceterai/Enternia/wiki)

**Version 2.1: Alta Decryption** is out! Check out the changelog for details.  
The full list of changes can be found in the changelog file on the GitHub page or in the Steam changelog page.

## Where to start

To explore the worlds added by this mod, try to find new planet types around tier 3+ stars!

To start progressing in the mod content, craft an ![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/objects/alta/crafting/crafting_station/icon1.png) [Alta Crafting Station](https://github.com/Ceterai/Enternia/wiki/Alta-Crafting-Station)! It should be available at the tier 2 Inventor's Table.  
From there, you'll be able to craft:

- mod equipment (armor, weapons, throwables, etc);
- other mod crafting tables;
- all mod items that can normally be only found through loot (requires max tier).

Other crafting tables include:

- ![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/objects/alta/crafting/constructor/icon1.png) [Alta Constructor](https://github.com/Ceterai/Enternia/wiki/Alta-Constructor) for crafting objects/decorations/traps (upgrading to max tier allows you to even craft natural objects and loot tables);
- ![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/objects/alta/crafting/datacenter/icon.png) [Alta Datacenter](https://github.com/Ceterai/Enternia/wiki/Alta-Datacenter) for crafting codexes the tell you the lore and/or explain how certain mod items work (highly recommend to read them so you don't have to visit the wiki);
- ![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/objects/alta/crafting/upgrade_station/icon1.png) [Alta Upgrade Station](https://github.com/Ceterai/Enternia/wiki/Alta-Upgrade-Station) for upgrading some mod items in exchange for ![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/items/throwables/ct_gheatsyn_shard.png) [Gheatsyn Shards](https://github.com/Ceterai/Enternia/wiki/Gheatsyn-Shard).
- ![ ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ceterai/Enternia/main/objects/alta/crafting/deprecation_station/icon.png) [Deprecation Station](https://github.com/Ceterai/Enternia/wiki/Deprecation-Station) is a tiny crafting table that allows you to convert deprecated items/objects to new ones, or exchange Perfectly Generic Items for different presents.
